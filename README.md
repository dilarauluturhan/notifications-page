## What I Learned
I have completed the "Notifications Page" challenge from the Frontend Mentor platform. This project aimed to using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used techniques such as CSS flexbox and media queries to create a comprehensive responsive design and user-friendly interface. I paid attention to a modular structure and clean coding principles.
